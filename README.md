Hi!

I’m Shima Abdulla, a graduate from the University of Maryland, College Park. Go Terps! I received a Bachelor of Science in Information Science with a specialization in Data Science in May of 2021. Upon graduating within the top 3% of my class at the iSchool (Magna cum laude), I began my professional career as a Business Analyst in Fairfax, Virginia. It was here that I truly discovered my love for technology. As an analyst I was able to experience many aspects of a technical project’s lifecycle, including the planning, developing, testing, and deploying stages. I especially developed a love for Web Development and Cloud Computing. Although I have graduated university, I still love to learn thus I hope to share an array of my personal and academic projects created in a series of languages including, but not limited to, Python, SQL, and R, as I continue learning and growing.

Thanks,

Shima
